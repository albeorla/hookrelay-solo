## Getting Started

### For Project Managers
1. Review the [Epic Overview](./epic-modular-platform.md) for business context
2. Use [Templates & Guidelines](./templates-and-guidelines.md) for sprint planning
3. Monitor progress using the story point tracking system

### For Developers  
1. Read [Stories Breakdown](./stories-breakdown.md) for technical requirements
2. Follow [Detailed Tasks](./tasks-detailed.md) for implementation guidance
3. Use code review checklists from templates for quality assurance

### For Stakeholders
1. Track business value delivery through story completion
2. Review architecture decisions in weekly reviews
3. Validate module functionality through demo sessions

## Quality Gates

Each story must pass through defined quality gates:

1. **Design Review** - Architecture and SOLID compliance
2. **Implementation Review** - Code quality and testing  
3. **Integration Review** - End-to-end functionality
4. **Production Readiness** - Performance and security validation

## Communication Plan

- **Daily Standups**: Progress tracking and blocker resolution
- **Weekly Architecture Reviews**: Design decisions and technical debt
- **Sprint Reviews**: Feature demos and stakeholder feedback  
- **Retrospectives**: Process improvements and lessons learned

## Risk Management

**High-Risk Areas**:
- Integration Framework complexity (Story 2)
- Billing Module security requirements (Story 4)
- Performance impact of module indirection

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Early proof-of-concepts for complex integrations
- Security-first approach with regular reviews
- Continuous performance monitoring and optimization

This project represents a significant architectural evolution that will position the platform for scalable growth while maintaining enterprise-grade quality standards. Success depends on strict adherence to SOLID principles, comprehensive testing, and continuous stakeholder engagement throughout the development process.
