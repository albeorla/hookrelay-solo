# Project Management Templates & Guidelines

This document provides templates, estimation guidelines, and best practices for managing the Modular Startup Platform development.

## Estimation Guidelines

### Story Point Scale (Modified Fibonacci)
- **1 Point**: Simple task, 1-2 hours, no complexity
- **2 Points**: Small task, half day, minimal complexity  
- **3 Points**: Medium task, 1 day, some complexity
- **5 Points**: Large task, 2-3 days, moderate complexity
- **8 Points**: Very large task, 1 week, high complexity
- **13 Points**: Epic-level task, needs breakdown

### Effort Estimation Factors
Consider these factors when estimating tasks:

**Technical Complexity**
- New technology or patterns (+25%)
- Integration with multiple systems (+15%)
- Performance requirements (+20%)
- Security requirements (+15%)

**Risk Factors**
- External dependencies (+20%)
- Unclear requirements (+30%)
- Tight deadlines (+15%)
- Limited expertise (+25%)

**Quality Requirements**
- 100% test coverage (+20%)
- Enterprise-grade error handling (+15%)
- Comprehensive documentation (+10%)
- Performance benchmarking (+10%)

### Capacity Planning
- **Sprint Length**: 2 weeks
- **Developer Capacity**: 8 points per sprint (accounting for meetings, code reviews, etc.)
- **Buffer**: 20% for unexpected issues and technical debt
- **Learning Curve**: Additional 25% for first iteration of new patterns
