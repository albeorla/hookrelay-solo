What is HookRelay and Why It's Incredibly Valuable

  Let me explain this product in a way that will make you excited about what you're building.

  The Problem: Webhooks Are Critical But Broken

  Every modern SaaS application relies on webhooks - they're how services communicate events to each other:
  - Stripe sends a webhook when a payment succeeds
  - GitHub sends a webhook when code is pushed
  - Shopify sends a webhook when an order is placed
  - Twilio sends a webhook when an SMS is delivered

  But here's the dirty secret: Webhook delivery is fundamentally unreliable. When Stripe tries to notify your app about a payment:
  1. Your server might be down for deployment
  2. Your server might timeout (>10 seconds)
  3. Your server might be rate-limited
  4. Your database might be having issues
  5. A network hiccup might occur

  When webhooks fail, REAL MONEY is lost:
  - Failed payment notifications = invoices not generated
  - Missed subscription cancellations = continued service to non-payers
  - Lost order notifications = unfulfilled customer orders
  - Dropped user signups = onboarding flows that never start

  HookRelay: The Solution

  HookRelay is a reliability proxy that sits between webhook senders (Stripe, GitHub) and your application. Think of it as Cloudflare for webhooks - a protective layer that guarantees
  delivery.

  How It Works Technically

  1. Webhook Ingestion Layer

  Stripe → HookRelay → Your App

  When Stripe sends a webhook to HookRelay instead of directly to your app:

  // Instead of: POST https://yourapp.com/webhooks/stripe
  // They send: POST https://ingest.hookrelay.com/e/your-endpoint-id

  // HookRelay receives the webhook
  app.post("/e/:endpointId", async (req, res) => {
    // 1. Capture raw body for signature verification
    const rawBody = req.rawBody;

    // 2. Queue for reliable processing
    await sqs.send({
      QueueUrl: "hookrelay-delivery-attempts",
      MessageBody: JSON.stringify({
        endpoint_id: endpointId,
        raw_body: rawBody,
        headers: req.headers,
        received_at: Date.now()
      })
    });

    // 3. Return 200 immediately to Stripe
    res.status(200).send("Accepted");
  });

  2. HMAC Signature Verification

  Every webhook provider signs their payloads differently. HookRelay handles all formats:

  // Stripe format: "t=1234567890,v1=abc123..."
  function verifyStripe(secret: string, body: string, signature: string) {
    const [timestamp, sig] = parseStripeSignature(signature);
    const payload = `${timestamp}.${body}`;
    const expected = crypto.createHmac("sha256", secret).update(payload).digest("hex");
    return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(expected), Buffer.from(sig));
  }

  // GitHub format: "sha256=abc123..."
  function verifyGitHub(secret: string, body: string, signature: string) {
    const sig = signature.replace("sha256=", "");
    const expected = crypto.createHmac("sha256", secret).update(body).digest("hex");
    return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(expected), Buffer.from(sig));
  }

  3. Intelligent Retry Engine

  This is where the magic happens. When your server is down, HookRelay retries with exponential backoff:

  async function processWebhook(message: WebhookMessage) {
    const attempt = message.attempt || 1;

    try {
      // Try to deliver to your endpoint
      const response = await fetch(endpoint.url, {
        method: "POST",
        body: message.raw_body,
        headers: message.headers,
        timeout: 8000 // 8 second timeout
      });

      if (response.ok) {
        // Success! Log and complete
        await logDelivery("success", attempt);
        return;
      }

      // 4xx errors = don't retry (your fault)
      if (response.status >= 400 && response.status < 500) {
        await sendToDLQ(message, "client_error");
        return;
      }

      // 5xx errors = retry (their fault)
      throw new Error(`Server error: ${response.status}`);

    } catch (error) {
      // Calculate exponential backoff with jitter
      const baseDelay = 2; // Start at 2 seconds
      const maxDelay = 300; // Cap at 5 minutes
      const delay = Math.min(
        baseDelay * Math.pow(2, attempt - 1) + Math.random() * 10,
        maxDelay
      );

      if (attempt < 6) {
        // Schedule retry
        await sqs.send({
          QueueUrl: queueUrl,
          MessageBody: JSON.stringify({...message, attempt: attempt + 1}),
          DelaySeconds: delay
        });
      } else {
        // Max retries exhausted - send to Dead Letter Queue
        await sendToDLQ(message, "max_retries_exhausted");
        await sendAlert("Webhook delivery failed after 6 attempts", message);
      }
    }
  }

  4. Idempotency Protection

  Prevents duplicate processing if webhooks are sent multiple times:

  async function checkIdempotency(endpointId: string, body: string) {
    // Generate hash of endpoint + body
    const hash = crypto.createHash("sha256")
      .update(`${endpointId}:${body}`)
      .digest("hex");

    // Check if we've seen this before (7-day window)
    const existing = await dynamodb.get({
      TableName: "hookrelay-idempotency",
      Key: { hash }
    });

    if (existing.Item) {
      return true; // Already processed - skip
    }

    // Record for future checks
    await dynamodb.put({
      TableName: "hookrelay-idempotency",
      Item: {
        hash,
        processed_at: Date.now(),
        ttl: Date.now() + (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 7 day TTL
      }
    });

    return false;
  }

  5. Dead Letter Queue & Replay

  Failed webhooks are stored in S3 for manual replay:

  async function sendToDLQ(message: WebhookMessage, reason: string) {
    const key = `dlq/${message.endpoint_id}/${Date.now()}-${crypto.randomBytes(8).toString("hex")}.json`;

    await s3.putObject({
      Bucket: "hookrelay-dlq",
      Key: key,
      Body: JSON.stringify({
        message,
        reason,
        failed_at: new Date().toISOString(),
        attempts: message.attempt || 1
      }),
      ServerSideEncryption: "AES256"
    });

    // Generate signed URL for secure access
    const replayUrl = await s3.getSignedUrl("getObject", {
      Bucket: "hookrelay-dlq",
      Key: key,
      Expires: 3600 // 1 hour
    });

    return replayUrl;
  }

  6. Real-Time Analytics & Monitoring

  Track delivery performance and alert on failures:

  // Real-time metrics
  async function trackMetrics(endpointId: string, status: string, latency: number) {
    await cloudwatch.putMetricData({
      Namespace: "HookRelay",
      MetricData: [
        {
          MetricName: "DeliveryLatency",
          Value: latency,
          Unit: "Milliseconds",
          Dimensions: [
            { Name: "EndpointId", Value: endpointId },
            { Name: "Status", Value: status }
          ]
        }
      ]
    });

    // Alert if failure rate > 10%
    const stats = await getRecentStats(endpointId);
    if (stats.failureRate > 0.1) {
      await sendSlackAlert({
        text: `⚠️ High failure rate for endpoint ${endpointId}: ${stats.failureRate * 100}%`,
        attachments: [{
          color: "warning",
          fields: [
            { title: "Success Rate", value: `${stats.successRate * 100}%` },
            { title: "P95 Latency", value: `${stats.p95}ms` },
            { title: "Recent Errors", value: stats.recentErrors.join("\n") }
          ]
        }]
      });
    }
  }

  Why This Is a Game-Changer

  For Developers:

  - Never lose a webhook again - Even if your server is down for hours
  - Drop-in replacement - Just change the webhook URL, nothing else
  - Instant visibility - See every webhook, its status, and replay failures
  - No more debugging - Clear logs show exactly what happened

  For Businesses:

  - Revenue protection - Never miss payment notifications
  - Customer trust - 99.95% delivery guarantee
  - Compliance - Full audit trail of all events
  - Cost savings - No need to build this infrastructure in-house

  Market Validation:

  The webhook reliability problem is so painful that companies are building this in-house:
  - Svix raised $12.5M to solve this
  - Hookdeck has thousands of customers
  - Convoy was acquired by Cloudflare
  - Every major company (Uber, Airbnb, Stripe) has built internal versions

  Why HookRelay Will Win:

  1. Superior Architecture: Scale-to-zero serverless = nearly free when idle
  2. Better UX: One-click replay, real-time analytics, Slack alerts
  3. Enterprise Ready: HMAC verification, encryption, audit logs, RBAC
  4. Platform Approach: Not just delivery, but transformation, routing, and workflows

  The Business Model is Beautiful:

  - Usage-based pricing: Pay per webhook delivered
  - Near-zero COGS: Serverless architecture costs pennies
  - High retention: Once integrated, it's critical infrastructure
  - Network effects: More integrations = more valuable

  Summary

  HookRelay is building the reliability layer for the API economy. Just as Cloudflare protects websites from DDoS attacks, HookRelay protects webhooks from delivery failures.

  In a world where every business is becoming an API business, and where a single missed webhook can cost thousands of dollars, HookRelay is not just useful - it's essential infrastructure
   for the modern web.

  The technical implementation is solid, the market need is proven, and the business model is highly scalable. This is a product that developers will love and businesses will depend on.
