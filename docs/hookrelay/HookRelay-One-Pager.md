# HookRelay — One‑Pager (Executive Summary)

## Overview
HookRelay is a reliability front door for webhooks — the event notifications that software platforms send to each other. We guarantee delivery, visibility, and control for mission‑critical events so teams ship faster with fewer incidents.

## Problem
- Teams lose or delay webhooks due to timeouts, outages, or brittle retry logic.
- Missed events mean failed invoices, broken workflows, support load, and lost trust.

## Solution
- Managed ingest with signature verification and idempotency
- Intelligent retries with exponential backoff + jitter
- Dead‑letter queue (S3) and one‑click/bulk replay
- Delivery analytics (success rate, p50/p95, top failures)
- Alerts (Slack/email) and audit logging
- “Nearly costless” idle architecture: API Gateway → SQS + scale‑to‑zero Fargate worker

## Why Now
- API‑first products and automation are exploding; reliability expectations are rising.
- Buyers increasingly prefer to “buy reliability” over building in‑house.

## ICP & Market
- ICP: SaaS platforms, product/API teams, platform engineering, SRE.
- Starts bottoms‑up, expands to platform and compliance buyers (security reviews, IP allowlists, audit).

## Product Highlights
- Fast setup: drop‑in ingest URL, Stripe/GitHub HMAC compatibility
- Deep visibility: delivery log, metrics, replay in minutes
- Secure by default: KMS encryption, short‑lived signed URLs, audit, GDPR delete

## Business Model
- Metered usage: charged per successful delivery with free tier and tiered limits
- 7‑day grace period; Stripe billing; low COGS due to serverless + Fargate Spot

## Traction & Milestones (First 90 Days)
- MVP: ingest → retry → DLQ → replay; analytics; Slack/email alerts; billing
- Design partners: 5–10 teams; targets: ≥99.5% delivery success; p95 ≤ 250 ms
- KPIs: Day‑7 activation ≥ 40%; Trial → paid ≥ 30%

## Go‑To‑Market
- Self‑serve docs and SDKs; integration guides (Stripe, GitHub, Segment)
- Content + community (GitHub/StackOverflow/PH); light sales‑assist for security reviews

## Team & Moat
- Strong infra/DevEx DNA; speed to value and UX depth
- Moat via analytics depth, replay ergonomics, and operational excellence

## Use of Funds (Typical Seed)
- Build: transforms, multi‑region, enterprise features
- GTM: dev marketing, integrations, design‑partner success
