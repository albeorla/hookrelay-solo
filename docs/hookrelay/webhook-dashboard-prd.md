## UI Design Principles

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Status-First**: Delivery status should be immediately visible through color coding
- **Scannable Lists**: Tables optimized for quick scanning with clear visual separators
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Details available on-demand without cluttering the interface

### Color System
- **Success**: Green (#10B981) - Successful deliveries
- **Warning**: Yellow (#F59E0B) - Retrying or slow deliveries
- **Error**: Red (#EF4444) - Failed deliveries
- **Pending**: Blue (#3B82F6) - In-progress deliveries
- **Neutral**: Gray (#6B7280) - Inactive or disabled states

### Interaction Patterns
- **Inline Actions**: Common actions (retry, view details) available without navigation
- **Bulk Selection**: Checkbox pattern for multiple item selection
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket/SSE for live delivery status
- **Responsive Tables**: Mobile-friendly with horizontal scroll or card view

### Performance Considerations
- **Pagination**: 50 items default, configurable up to 200
- **Virtualized Lists**: For large datasets
- **Lazy Loading**: Details loaded on-demand
- **Optimistic UI**: Immediate feedback for user actions

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js App Router (existing T3 stack)
- **Components**: shadcn/ui components for consistency
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Real-time**: WebSockets or Server-Sent Events
- **Charts**: Recharts or Tremor for analytics

### API Requirements
- **tRPC Procedures**: All dashboard operations through tRPC
- **Pagination**: Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- **Filtering**: Server-side filtering for performance
- **Real-time**: Subscription support for live updates

### Data Requirements
- **Retention**: 30 days for free tier, 90 days for paid
- **Performance**: <200ms response time for list views
- **Export Limits**: 10,000 records per export
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests/minute per user
