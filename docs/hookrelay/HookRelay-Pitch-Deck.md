# HookRelay — Pitch Deck Outline (with Speaker Notes)

1) Title & Mission
- Title: HookRelay — Reliable Webhooks, Delivered
- Tagline: The reliability front door for your platform
- Speaker notes: Introduce team and mission to make webhook delivery dependable and observable.

2) Problem
- Missed/late webhooks break revenue and workflows; teams rebuild reliability over and over
- Speaker notes: Real examples (missed invoice, failed provisioning); rising reliability expectations

3) Solution
- Managed ingest, verification, idempotency, retries, DLQ, replay, analytics, alerts
- Speaker notes: Emphasize speed-to-value and “own the last mile” for webhooks

4) Product Tour (Screens / GIF)
- Delivery log, replay action, p50/p95 charts, alert cards
- Speaker notes: Narrative: detect issue → alert → replay → verify metrics

5) Architecture & Differentiation
- API Gateway → SQS → Fargate worker (scale-to-zero), DDB, S3 DLQ, KMS
- Differentiators: analytics depth, replay ergonomics, audit + security
- Speaker notes: Cost efficiency and reliability SLOs (p95 ≤ 250 ms ingest ACK)

6) Market & ICP
- ICP: SaaS platforms, product/API teams, platform engineering
- Market tailwinds: API-first growth, automation, reliability budgets
- Speaker notes: Top-down vs. bottoms-up entry points

7) Competition & Why We Win
- DIY and vendor alternatives; gaps: UX, analytics, replay speed, cost
- Speaker notes: Focus on ergonomics for engineers + provable reliability for execs

8) Business Model
- Metered usage by successful deliveries; free tier + tiers; 7‑day grace
- Speaker notes: Gross margin lever via serverless and spot; expansion via analytics/enterprise features

9) Go-To-Market
- Self-serve docs/SDKs, integration guides (Stripe/GitHub/Segment)
- Community/content + light sales-assist for security reviews
- Speaker notes: Land with devs, expand to platform owners

10) Traction & Roadmap
- Early design partners, KPIs (activation, conversion), SLOs
- Next: transforms, multi-region, enterprise controls
- Speaker notes: Clear proof points and upcoming catalysts

11) Team
- Infra/DevEx experience; advisors and prior wins
- Speaker notes: Why this team ships reliability products well

12) Financials & Use of Funds
- 24‑month plan: team, infra, GTM; efficient burn via serverless
- Speaker notes: Hiring plan, runway, milestone-linked spend

13) The Ask
- Amount, runway, key hires, design partner intros
- Speaker notes: Clear close and next steps

Appendix
- Security: encryption, RBAC, retention, IP allowlists
- SLOs & error budget policy; sample runbooks
